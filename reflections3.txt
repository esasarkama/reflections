Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
In order to know what you have.
Probably you don't want to pull changes made by other people, want to check them first(?)

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
Fork: to make my own "copy" of a repository in GitHub.
Clone: make a copy in local repository
Branch: make a branch on existing "project"

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
One can work off-line and later sync the local and remote stuff.
